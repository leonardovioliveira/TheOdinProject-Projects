    <h1>A delicious recipe for French Fries!</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <em> No false promises - these french fries really stay crisp! </em>
      </strong>
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Potato</li>
      <p>
        The type is important. Starchy, floury potatoes are the potatoes you
        need for crispy fries.
      </p>
      <li>Vinegar</li>
      <p>
        For simmering the potatoes, it is one secret weapon for perfect fries.
        There is no trace of vinegar flavour once cooked. See Step 4 below for
        the why.
      </p>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <p>
        For seasoning the water so the potatoes are seasoned all the way
        through.
      </p>
      <li>Oil</li>
      <p>
        For frying. I use vegetable or canola oil which are neutrally-flavoured
        oils. Re-using the oil: The oil can be re-used 3 to 4 times, or more. It
        won't even need to be strained. Just cool, pour into jars and keep in
        the pantry, and have a browse in this recipe collection to decide what
        to make next!
      </p>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to make:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut fries</li>
      <p>
        First, we have to cut our fries. A neat little crispy fries trick you
        may not have seen before: use a serrated knife to cut the potatoes.
        Though not visible to the eye, it makes the surface rougher therefore
        creating more surface area to crisp up = crispier fries!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What size to cut the fries:</strong>6 mm / 1/4″ batons is the
        ideal size for optimum crispiness and fluffy insides. Thicker = less
        crispy. Thinner = not enough fluffiness inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to slice:</strong>Cut a whole potato into 6 mm / 1/4″ thick
        slices. Stack 2 or 3 slices then cut into 6 mm / 1/4″ thick batons.
      </p>
      <li>Keep in water to prevent browning</li>
      <p>
        Keep cut fries in water to prevent them from browning as you continue
        cutting. No soaking time is actually required. A simple rinse followed
        by simmering the potatoes in vinegar water takes care of this for us.
      </p>

      <li>Rinse</li>
      <p>
        Once all the fries are cut, place in a colander then rinse under tap
        water for 15 – 20 seconds. This is the first step to remove excess
        sugars from the surface of the potatoes (more on the “why” of this
        below, but in short it’s to aid crispiness – of course!). Meanwhile, the
        insides remain untouched by water so they’ll cook up nice and fluffy.
      </p>

      <li>Cook in vinegar water = superior crispiness</li>
      <p>
        Once the potatoes are rinsed, place them in a pot with cold tap water,
        vinegar and salt. Bring to a boil on high heat then immediately turn
        down to low so the surface is barely rippling. Cook for 10 minutes.
      </p>
      <li>Drain and dry</li>
      <p>
        Use a spider or large slotted spoon to remove the potatoes from the
        water into a colander. Then carefully spread the potatoes out on two tea
        towel-lined trays to steam dry for 5 minutes. No need to pat them dry,
        the residual heat will do the job for us.
      </p>

      <li>Cooking vessel and oil</li>
      <p>
        <strong>Cooking vessel</strong> - Use a heavy-based, large pot that is
        at least 10 cm / 4″ deep. We need:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Oil Temperature - Preheat the oil to 205°C/400°F. Use a thermometer
          to monitor the temperature. I use a Thermapen, see my Essential
          Kitchenwares post for more details.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <li>Fry #1</li>
      <p>
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> For safety reasons, please follow the
        directions to pause 10 seconds between adding batches of more potato
        into the oil! As you can see in the photos below, the oil bubbles up
        quite high and vigorously as soon as you add some potato. If you add all
        the potato in one go, the oil will bubble up even higher and faster,
        which is risky. I’m speaking from first hand experience here!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cook the fries in 3 batches </strong> – Separate the cooked
        potatoes into 3 even piles (batches). We will be doing Fry #1 in three
        batches in a 24 cm / 10″ pot. If your pot is larger or smaller, adjust
        the number of batches accordingly so all the fries in one batch can
        float in a single layer in the oil.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Add 1/3 of Batch #1 -</strong> Using a spider or slotted spoon,
        carefully add 1/3 of the first batch into the oil.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>WAIT 10 seconds -</strong>then add another 1/3 of batch #1.
        Pausing before adding more fries is important to ensure the oil doesn’t
        bubble up too high. Use this time to load up, ready to add more fries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Repeat -</strong>Wait 10 seconds, then add the final 1/3 of
        Batch #1.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fry 50 seconds -</strong>Once all the fries are in, start the
        timer and fry for 50 seconds, moving the fries around once or twice.
      </p>
      <li>Cool 30 minutes</li>
      <p>
        Remove the fries from the oil using a slotted spoon and spread onto a
        paper towel-lined tray in a single layer. They will be pale and not yet
        crispy. Carry out Fry #1 for the remaining two batches using the same
        staggered approach (ie. 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3) within each batch. Ensure the
        oil is back at 205°C/400°F before starting each batch. Then cool all the
        fries for 30 minutes on some paper towel-lined trays.
      </p>

      <li>Fry #2 – crisp them up!</li>
      <p>
        After cooling the fries, heat the oil to 205°C/400°F again. Now fry half
        all the french fries for 4 minutes until they are a gorgeous golden
        colour and wonderfully crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon into a large
        paper towel-lined bowl then repeat with the remaining fries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why a bowl instead of tray to hold the fries?</strong>A bowl
        keeps the cooked fries warmer whilst still allowing for oil drainage.
        This way the first batch you cook will still be hot by the time you
        finish cooking the second batch. The bowl also doubles as a suitable
        tossing vessel once sprinkled with your favourite seasoning, as you’ll
        see later!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to cook lots of fries and serve them all hot?</strong
        >Completed fries can be flash-fried for an extra 30 seconds to 1 minute
        to reheat. This way you can serve up all the fries piping hot!
      </p>
      <li>Seasoning!</li>
      <p>
        Now that your fries are done, sprinkle with salt or your favourite fries
        seasoning while hot so the salt sticks. Toss, then serve! Remember,
        these fries will stay crispy for more than 15 minutes, though of course
        they are best consumed piping hot! Tip: Remember these French fries are
        also pre-salted inside because we blanched them in salted water. So
        don’t go too crazy with the seasoning salt. Sprinkle judiciously, taste
        (I know, I hate to ask that of you), and then sprinkle more if you think
        it needs it.
