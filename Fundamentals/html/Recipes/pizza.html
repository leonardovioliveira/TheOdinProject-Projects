      <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For the sauce</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>100ml passata</li>
      <li>Handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried</li>
      <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For the topping</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced</li>
      <li>Handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
      <li>Handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
      <li>Handful of basil leaves (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to make</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Step 1</li>
      <p>
        <strong>Make the base:</strong> Put the flour into a large bowl, then
        stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and
        the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a
        soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead
        for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can
        leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin
        crust.
      </p>
      <li>Step 2</li>
      <p>
        <strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Mix the passata, basil and crushed
        garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room
        temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
      </p>
      <li>Step 3</li>
      <p>
        <strong>Roll out the dough:</strong> if you’ve let the dough rise, give
        it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll
        out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin.
        The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the
        rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
      </p>
      <li>Step 4</li>
      <p>
        <strong>Top and bake:</strong> heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put
        another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top
        shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with
        cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza,
        still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake
        for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil
        leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
